A table characterizing baseline characteristics is so important that it’s typically the first table that appears in any observational epidemiology (or clinical trial) manuscript, so it’s commonly referred to as a “Table 1”. The “Table 1” contain information about the mean and standard deviation(or median and IQR) for continue/scale variable, and proportion for categorical variable. Baseline characteristic table should be created before imputaion, matching, or weighting. * Using data final_db * Outcome variable : HTN * Follow-up period : DATEDIFF * Exposure variable : DM * Covariates : Age, Sex, SES, Region, BMI, CCI, Comorbidities(Dyslipidemia, Ischemic heart disease) ## load library library(moonBook) library(dplyr) ## load data final_db &lt;- read.csv(&#39;Data/final_db.csv&#39;, header=T) ## formula formula.bc &lt;- formula(DM ~ HTN + DATEDIFF + AGE + SEX + SES + REGION + BMI + CCI + DYS + IHD) Use mytable() function in moonBook package to create baseline characteristic tables. method=1 : forces analysis as normal-distributed method=3 : performs a Shapiro-Wilk test to decide between normal or non-normal 1.1 Baseline characteristic table mytable(formula.bc, data=final_db, method=3) ## ## Descriptive Statistics by &#39;DM&#39; ## —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— ## 0 1 p ## (N=2356) (N=118) ## —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— ## HTN 0.000 ## - 0 2215 (94.0%) 69 (58.5%) ## - 1 141 ( 6.0%) 49 (41.5%) ## DATEDIFF 1685.0 [835.5;2460.5] 963.5 [324.0;1690.0] 0.000 ## AGE 36.0 [22.0;48.0] 58.0 [50.0;68.0] 0.000 ## SEX 0.903 ## - 1 1182 (50.2%) 58 (49.2%) ## - 2 1174 (49.8%) 60 (50.8%) ## SES 0.393 ## - 1 668 (29.6%) 29 (25.2%) ## - 2 709 (31.4%) 34 (29.6%) ## - 3 883 (39.1%) 52 (45.2%) ## REGION 0.996 ## - 1 1160 (49.5%) 58 (49.2%) ## - 2 489 (20.9%) 25 (21.2%) ## - 3 694 (29.6%) 35 (29.7%) ## BMI 23.1 [21.0;25.2] 24.3 [22.6;26.1] 0.013 ## CCI 0.001 ## - 0 1810 (76.8%) 80 (67.8%) ## - 1 433 (18.4%) 23 (19.5%) ## - 2 113 ( 4.8%) 15 (12.7%) ## DYS 0.000 ## - 0 2285 (97.0%) 100 (84.7%) ## - 1 71 ( 3.0%) 18 (15.3%) ## IHD 0.476 ## - 0 2340 (99.3%) 116 (98.3%) ## - 1 16 ( 0.7%) 2 ( 1.7%) ## —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 1.2 Baseline characteristic table_total tot1 &lt;- final_db %&gt;% mutate(tmp=1) tot2 &lt;- final_db %&gt;% mutate(tmp=2) tot3 &lt;- rbind(tot1,tot2) mytable(tmp ~ HTN + DATEDIFF + AGE + SEX + SES + REGION + BMI + CCI + DYS + IHD, data=tot3, method=3) ## ## Descriptive Statistics by &#39;tmp&#39; ## ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— ## 1 2 p ## (N=2474) (N=2474) ## ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— ## HTN 1.000 ## - 0 2284 (92.3%) 2284 (92.3%) ## - 1 190 ( 7.7%) 190 ( 7.7%) ## DATEDIFF 1656.0 [811.0;2458.0] 1656.0 [811.0;2458.0] 1.000 ## AGE 36.0 [22.0;50.0] 36.0 [22.0;50.0] 1.000 ## SEX 1.000 ## - 1 1240 (50.1%) 1240 (50.1%) ## - 2 1234 (49.9%) 1234 (49.9%) ## SES 1.000 ## - 1 697 (29.3%) 697 (29.3%) ## - 2 743 (31.3%) 743 (31.3%) ## - 3 935 (39.4%) 935 (39.4%) ## REGION 1.000 ## - 1 1218 (49.5%) 1218 (49.5%) ## - 2 514 (20.9%) 514 (20.9%) ## - 3 729 (29.6%) 729 (29.6%) ## BMI 23.2 [21.0;25.3] 23.2 [21.0;25.3] 1.000 ## CCI 1.000 ## - 0 1890 (76.4%) 1890 (76.4%) ## - 1 456 (18.4%) 456 (18.4%) ## - 2 128 ( 5.2%) 128 ( 5.2%) ## DYS 1.000 ## - 0 2385 (96.4%) 2385 (96.4%) ## - 1 89 ( 3.6%) 89 ( 3.6%) ## IHD 1.000 ## - 0 2456 (99.3%) 2456 (99.3%) ## - 1 18 ( 0.7%) 18 ( 0.7%) ## ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
