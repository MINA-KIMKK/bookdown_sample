# Baseline characteristic table  

 Baseline tables show the characteristics of research subjects included in a study. A table characterizing baseline characteristics is so important that it’s typically the first table that appears in any observational epidemiology (or clinical trial) manuscript, so it’s commonly referred to as a "Table 1". The "Table 1" contain information about the mean and standard deviation(or median and IQR) for continue/scale variable, and proportion for categorical variable.    
 <br/>
 
 Baseline characteristic table should be created before imputaion, matching, or weighting.   


<br/>

----
Using data **final_db**    
Outcome variable : **HTN**     
Follow-up period : **DATEDIFF**    
Exposure variable : **DM**     
Covariates : **Age, Sex, SES, Region, BMI, CCI, Comorbidities(Dyslipidemia, Ischemic heart disease)**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE)

```

```{r}
## load data
final_db <- read.csv('Data/final_db.csv', header=T)
```
     
```{r}
## formula
formula.bc <- formula(DM ~ HTN + DATEDIFF + AGE + SEX + SES + REGION + BMI + CCI + DYS + IHD)

* Use **mytable()** function in **moonBook** package to create baseline characteristic tables.
  - method=1 : forces analysis as normal-distributed        
  - method=3 : performs a Shapiro-Wilk test to decide between normal or non-normal


## Baseline characteristic table
```{r}
mytable(formula.bc, data=final_db, method=3) 
```

## Baseline characteristic table_total
```{r}
tot1 <- final_db %>% mutate(tmp=1)
tot2 <- final_db %>% mutate(tmp=2)
tot3 <- rbind(tot1,tot2)

mytable(tmp ~ HTN + DATEDIFF + AGE + SEX + SES + REGION + BMI + CCI + DYS + IHD, data=tot3, method=3)

# Multiple imputation  

 Multiple imputation is a general approach to the problem of missing data. It aims to allow for the uncertainty about the missing data by creating several different plausible imputed data sets and appropriately combining results obtained from each of them.    
   
<br/>
 
 Multiple imputation using chained equations (MICE) were performed to generate 10 imputed datasets. For the imputation model, predictive mean matching was used for continuous data and logistic regression was used for binary data. 

<br/>

Using data **final_db**    
Outcome variable : **HTN**     
Follow-up period : **DATEDIFF**    
Exposure variable : **DM**

library(mice)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
## load data
final_db <- read.csv('Data/final_db.csv', header=T)
```
     
## The number of missing values
```{r}
na_count <- function(data){
  num.na <- colSums(is.na(data))
  per.na <- paste0(round(colSums(is.na(data))/nrow(data) *100,2),"%")
  
  return(data.frame(missing=paste0(num.na,"(",per.na,")"),row.names = names(num.na)))
}

na_count(final_db)
```

<br/>

* Use **mice()** function in **mice** package to deal with missing data.
  - m=10 refers to the number of imputed datasets. Five is the default value.
  - Extract imputed data sets using **compleate()** function  



## Imputation for missing values
```{r}
## Exclude subject ID, index date before imputation
dat_mice <- final_db %>% select(-RN_INDI, -INDEX_DT, -FU_DT) 
dat_imp <- mice(dat_mice, m=10, seed=1)
```

```{r}
## Create 10 imputed data
for (i in 1:dat_imp$m){
  z <- assign(paste0('dat_imp',i),complete(dat_imp,i))
  assign(paste0('dat_imp',i),cbind(z,final_db %>% select(RN_INDI))) 
}

## list of 10 imputed data 
dat_imp_list <- list(dat_imp1,dat_imp2,dat_imp3,dat_imp4,dat_imp5,dat_imp6,dat_imp7,dat_imp8,dat_imp9,dat_imp10)

```

```{r}
## Save multiple imputation result
save(dat_imp,file="Data/dat_imp.RData")
## Save list for imputed data
save(dat_imp_list,file="Data/dat_imp_list.RData")
```

# Cross-references {#cross}

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Chapters and sub-chapters

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# Parts

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

# Footnotes and citations 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>

## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

# Sharing your book

## Publishing

HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html

## 404 pages

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a `_404.Rmd` or `_404.md` file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.



This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file. 

Read more about the features of this output format here:

https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html

Or use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?bookdown::gitbook
```
